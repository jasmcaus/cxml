## Overview

The test library used is minimalistic, and written solely to test CXML, inspired by the test library [Greatest](https://github.com/silentbicycle/greatest).


### Organization

The tests are arranged and divided according to the implementations.
Each test folder tests everything under the source implementation corresponding to the test folder names.
